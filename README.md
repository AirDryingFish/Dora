# FAQs

***Q1: Why a compact or smaller latent space is important?***
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="assets/latent_length_xcube_.png"/>
</p>
A: The reconstruction quality of XCube-VAE is pretty good! However, it requires a larger latent space. We note that a compact latent space is crucial for the faster convergence of diffusion training, which leads to lower training difficulty and reduced computational resource requirements.
Through a more careful evaluation, we find the XCube-VAE generates latent vectors of average 64,821 dimension in our training data. Our VAE model allows a batchsize of 128 on an A100 GPU, while the XCube-VAE only archives a batchsize of 2 on the same GPU.


***Q2: Can SNE or normal be used to further enhance the reconstruction quality?***

A: In our earlier experiment, we designed a new efficient algorithm within the vecset-based architecture to render the normal map. The purpose was to compute the mean squared error (MSE) loss or GAN loss between the predicted normal and the ground-truth (GT) normal. Unfortunately, the experiment failed, and we observed that the results were even worse. For mse loss, here are the possible reasons for this failure. First, to render normals, we must initially predict an occupancy field. Subsequently, we apply a differentiable marching cube algorithm to this occupancy field to extract a mesh. Finally, a differentiable renderer such as nvdiffrast is employed to render the normals. However, both the mesh extraction and the rendering processes introduce errors. Moreover, during backpropagation, the gradient chain has to pass through the occupancy field. In the context of the optimization problem, using normals for supervision is essentially equivalent to using the occupancy for supervision. Since we already have the ground truth of the occupancy field, it raises the question of whether it is truly necessary to use normals, which involve a longer propagation chain, for supervision. 

In addition to the above reasons, for the GAN loss, the normals rendered from the meshes reconstructed by the 3D VAE are absolutely clean. They are free of noise, have no background, show no high-frequency texture variations, and conform to physical constraints. This is different from the RGB images reconstructed by the 2D VAE, which contain some noise, cluttered backgrounds, and significant high-frequency variations. It's important to note that the experiment's failure might also be attributed to incorrect code or the presence of bugs. The above analysis is merely a post-hoc attempt to understand the outcome and does not guarantee a correct explanation.

***Q3: What's the difference between point query and leanenable quary in the input of the VAE encoder?***

A: According to the experiments conducted in 3DShape2VecSet, the performance of point query is better than that of learnable query. The model with point query as input has better generalization ability.
The length of the point query is actually equivalent to that of the latent code, and we found that it has a great property: it is more flexible compared to the learnable query. During inference, it can easily switch between lengths that were not seen during training without introducing additional parameters. In contrast, the model trained with learnable query cannot use lengths that were not encountered during training at test time, which limits its flexibility.

***Q4: Any interesting findings?***
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="assets/attention_map.jpg"/>
</p>
A: We visualized the cross-attention map of the encoder and found that the query points (colored green) tend to pay more attention to the point clouds in their surrounding areas (where redder indicates more attention and blacker indicates less attention).
